2: original version. Holes were 1.0922

2.1 — 5.13.20: moved "TOP" a little northward to hide it when installed.

2.2 - tried .9 holes. They're a little too small 

2.3 - trying 0.9961 holes and adding optional standoff between booster and pcb

2.4 — 6.29.20: holes still to small. 1.0922+0.9961/2 = 1.04415
	6.30.20: added ground fills.
